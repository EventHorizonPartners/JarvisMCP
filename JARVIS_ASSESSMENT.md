# 🤖 **JARVIS MCP ASSESSMENT** - **Nexus Development Focus**

*Current State Analysis and Next Steps for Nexus-Focused Development Acceleration*

## 🎯 **MISSION STATEMENT**

**Primary Objective**: Build Jarvis MCP incrementally to support NEXUS development specifically - not the grand vision, but practical tools that enhance Nexus strategy development for trading market front-end delivery.

**Development Philosophy**: 
- **Proximate, Adjacent, Confluent**: Always stay right in front of us, don't overbuild
- **Mechanical Extraction**: Extract Catalyst components then fix - don't creatively rewrite (hard-earned lesson)
- **Documentation First**: Define what we're building before any coding, simulation and planning phase
- **Basic Tools First**: Infrastructure in place before advanced features like dynamic context injection
- **Nexus-Focused**: Burning need to get back to Nexus development, don't sabotage with over-improvement

**UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE: No coding, only documentation and planning**

1. **Complete Documentation**: Define exact functionality, interfaces, and extraction strategy
2. **Knowledge Graph Architecture**: Plan integration of Universal Event Schema with Nexus development
3. **Storage Strategy**: Design how to capture and store all development interactions as events
4. **Markdown → Knowledge Graph**: Plan transformation of current documentation into intelligent context
5. **Simulate Workflows**: Model how tools will integrate with Nexus development 
6. **Validate Approach**: Ensure plans align with Roger's Nexus development priorities
7. **Plan Mechanical Extraction**: Strategy for extracting Catalyst components without creative rewriting

### **Real-World Problem Examples**

**Problem 1 - Lost Observations**: Roger just experienced losing all observations when hitting wrong button
**PTY Capture Solution**: Would have captured entire session, preventing any loss of insights
**Knowledge Graph Enhancement**: Observations become persistent event nodes, queryable across sessions
